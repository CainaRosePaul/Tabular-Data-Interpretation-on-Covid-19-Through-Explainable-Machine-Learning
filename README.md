# Tabular-Data-Interpretation-on-Covid-19-Through-Explainable-Machine-Learning
This Project focus of addressing the black box nature  of machine learning

Utilizing H2O AutoML, I employed the best leaderboard search, with XGBoost ranking among the top 
models. For interpretation, I utilized LIME to determine variable importance. To compare results, Catboost, 
a boosting algorithm, was used alongside XGBoost. The SHAP library was employed for interpretation, 
effectively addressing the black-box nature of the issue and ensuring comprehensibility, even for nonprogrammers. This project significantly enhances explainability, making the outcome more 
understandable.
